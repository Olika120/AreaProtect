AreaProtect
===========

Protect PocketMine-MP Areas And Customize Them! (Alpha_1.4.x ONLY)

Development
===========
AreaProtect is still being developed and WILL have console errors or debug messages!

How it works
===========
The plugin will make a new folder with it's name in the plugins directory, and in that folder there will be a file named _config.yml_, where you can specify worlds.
If someone has the _areaprotect.action.edit_ permission (defaults to OPs), then that player can modify the world, while others will cannot.
